    Provide only ONE action per $JSON_BLOB, as shown:

    ```
    {{
    "action": $TOOL_NAME,
    "action_input": $INPUT
    }}
    ```

    Follow this format:

    Question: input question to answer
    Thought: consider previous and subsequent steps
    Action:
    ```
    $JSON_BLOB
    ```
    Observation: action result
    ... (repeat Thought/Action/Observation N times)
    Thought: I know what to respond
    Action:
    ```
    {{
    "action": "Final Answer",
    "action_input": "Final response to human"
    }}

    (reminder to respond in a JSON blob no matter what)
